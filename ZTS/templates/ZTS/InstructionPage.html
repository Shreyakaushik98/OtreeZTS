    <b>Sample Instructions</b>
    <p>
        The upcoming trading task will be conducted using a browser-based trading interface (see the image below for an illustration). 
        The task consists of three rounds: one practice, and two main rounds. Your combined performance in the two main rounds determines your compensation. 
        <br>
        <br>
        At the beginning of each round you will be endowed with an initial portfolio consisting of shares of a risky asset (Shares) and a safe asset (Cash), 
        worth a combined 10 000 currency units. 50% of this endowment will be in the form of the risky asset (Shares), and 50% will consist of the safe asset (Cash). 
        In each round, you can buy or sell Shares by clicking ”Buy” or “Sell” buttons of the corresponding size. Shares are characterized by higher volatility than Cash.
        <br>
        <br>
        The prices are historical daily closing prices of a real-world market index. Prices are predetermined, and your actions do not have an influence on market prices. 
        Any trade that you make will be executed instantly at the current market price. You can buy or sell as many shares as you want, 
        under the condition that you have sufficient funds for the transaction. No short-selling is possible. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The y-axis of the price chart adjusts automatically to the 
        current market price. These changes only reflect the current price, and are not informative for future price changes.
